# python_number_guess
A number guessing game I wrote in python


The functions.py file will have all of the function declarations in it besides main(), which will be in the main.py file

This program generates a random number 1-100 and then generates a number range to guess from as well as how many
attempts the user will have

If the user guesses the number they win, if they run out of attempts they lose
